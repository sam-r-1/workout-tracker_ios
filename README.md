# Workout Tracker

### About
* An iOS app I made as a personal project for tracking workouts at the gym or at home. Features fully customizable exercises, the ability to view historical performance by workout or by exercise, in-app stopwatch for exercises that require it, and more.
* Built using Swift, SwiftUI, Firebase, Firebase Cloud Firestore
* Note: The app's Firebase configuration is not include in this repository. Set up your own Firebase project if you want to run the app on your machine.

### Future Improvements
* Implement workout templates to allow users to easily record exercises in the same order repeatedly
* Add data visualization (charts/graphs)
* Improve functionality around doing multiple sets of the same exercise (currently possible, but has some undesired effects)
